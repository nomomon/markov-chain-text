# Markov Chain Text Generator in React.js

_Node.js, React_

## Description

This is a simple text generator that uses [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to generate text based on a given input. It is written in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and uses a self-written Markov chain implementation.

To generate the text, the user can either enter a text manually or paste text. The text is then parsed and the Markov chain is generated. The user can then generate text based on the Markov chain.

## Demo

A demo of the application can be found [here](https://nomomon.github.io/markov-chain-text/).
